jQuery Plugin KickStart with namespace, settings and methods.

Current version is more like concept, rather a kickstart.

The main goal: to find easy to use jQuery plugin structure with many methods, keeping all settings inside and using namespaces for event binding for quick standalone jQuery plugin development.
Additional points: keep close to recommendations on Plugins Authoring from jQuery http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
